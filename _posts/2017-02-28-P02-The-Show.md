### About the blog, Jekyll and Jekyll webpages with Plugins (inside github<br><br>
<div align="justify">
Alright Mr. Blog, you seem to be finally fixed, after giving me a lot of troubles (mostly on my end, but whatever, you can take the blame). I actually came up with the solution when trying to help someone. Sometimes by selfish way of thinking one may find that helping another is a waste of time. It actually works more on the other way - the one that's being helped is doing more to the helper than the helper himself is doing to the one he's aiding. Deep thinking, but it's just pure gold.

Here's what I came up with:

## Long read warning, Just trying to help -- there's a TL;DR version at the end

This issue gave me a huge headache so I really want to try to help you, sorry if I'm being nosey here. Thomas of course might have a better answer, but I think I can help, as I think I really understand how this works now. 

Adding to what Thomas' replied to me (concerning only needing to add the _site folder to the gh-pages branch):

There are two kind of jekyll themes:
1) Jekyll themes without plugins ([or with plugins allowed by github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-jekyll-plugins-to-a-github-pages-site/));
2) Jekyll themes with plugins;

Thomas' theme used to be plugin free as he said.. but not it has plugins!

## How it works: 

For themes **without plugins**, you can push the whole build into your repository and just by adding your markdown posts into your _posts folder, **github will build and deploy for you** (as for example, doing `jekyll build` locally). The only thing you need to do is to manually add the categories as I described, but that's only if you add new ones.

For themes with **custom plugins**, you have to build the site at your computer (`sudo bundle exec jekyll build` for me) and then manually commit the files inside _sites to your gh-pages branch (and if you want, commit the whole build to another branch, just to keep the code open).

As Thomas' theme now has a plugin to handle the categories, they'll **only** be built locally (by `jekyll build`). That's why it works at your computer, because it's only instancing _site folder. If you deploy the whole build to github, github itself will try to build it as it supports Jekyll nativelly, so it will **ignore** the plugins, which means it will ignore the plugin that makes the categories.

So either you revert to how the theme was before, just like I did on the explanation I posted above (so github manages everything... aside from having to manually add the categories in single html files.. all I have to do now is add the posts and it gets instantly deployed) or you use the current version (with plugins), build it manually on console and upload it every single time.

## TL;DR VERSION
To sum it up, you have two options:

a) revert to a version with modified _config.yml (that commits the categories you created at _categories folder), manually add _categories and add html files for each one, deploy it to github - all you have to do now is add the posts directly to github and it will build your blog (no need to `jekyll build` or `serve` ever again);
**or**
b) clone from master, build the site locally every time with `jekyll build` and deploy _site into gh-pages branch. Optional: clone the build to a master branch, just to share the code;

I'm going with "a" (previous build) as it's a lot faster.. I love github being able to build the site by itself, I can even post from my cellphone if needed with a markdown editor.
The only problem is it there are new updates to the theme, so it might be a bit of an issue to 'catch up' and implement them.

Anyhow, here's more info:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28249255/how-do-i-configure-github-to-use-non-supported-jekyll-site-plugins/28252200#28252200

I hope it helped and I'm sorry if I wrote too much, really trying to help.

#### The path<br><br>
<div align="justify">
It really will be a long path. I had two game ideas in mind, which ended up being merged together. So while I work on "the Game", I'm also doing more and more Unity work, so I can keep improving.

Here are some (very) bad demos and stuff I have developed: 

### Lessons Learned<br><br>
<div align="justify">
Mostly, it's about to help others, without wanting anything back. To sum it up, one that helps do more for himself than for the receiver. Plus it's some mental relief and gives you a really nice feeling about what you have done. That's also a huge landmark concerning open-source. It's good to help, good to collaborate, good to work together.

### About the header's painting

  <figcaption>Painting by k04sk:  <a href="http://k04sk.deviantart.com/art/Path-333698884" title="Deviant"> [DA]</a> </figcaption>
</figure>

Judging by the angle, this great painting is actually really interesting. At first, what gives the impression of just being a perspective mistake (indeed it is really an illustration mistake, but that's not the relevant point here), is in fact what gives the greatness to this piece of art. The steps do not get narrower across the stairs - they do, however, keep the same width, no matter how many of them one has actually climbed. The same can be said about their height - they all seem to be the same.

Thinking about simple optics, the steps are *de facto* getting wider and higher. We can think about life and what comes across our path in the same way. Seems like a really daunting and steep path at first.. and it might actually be so. Or it might just be a perspective mistake. This is a really deep composition.
